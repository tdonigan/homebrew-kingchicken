// Overview
// ========
// This is a resource abstraction layer for qcom-dl to allow POSIX-style
// file operations with a variety of backends.
//
// The initial implementation provides backends for POSIX and ZIP libraries.
//
// Functionality is implemented by replacing FILE * with qcomdl_resource_t *
// which contains an identifier that determines which backend to use as well
// as backend-specific information about the file being accessed.
//
// Notes
// =====
//  - Wherever possible, POSIX function prototypes and return values are maintained
//  - fwrite is not implemented since qcom-dl does not need it for most operations
//    and it is not supported by the zip backend
